1!c (Overcall at Any Level)
- Treat opponent's overcall as an opening bid and apply our defense accordingly, except the following
- (1): <u>Borrow 6 HCP from partner</u>
- (2): Michael cuebids and unusual 2!n are off
- (3): Dbl tends not to be GF when cue-bid is available
- (4): Cue bids are GF. No Good suits to bid
- (5): 1!n does not promise a stopper. 2!n promise at least half-stopped
- (6): Jump in a suit when partner has shown strength is GF with good suit
- (7): T/O doubles by a capped player may be off-shape, followed by equal-level conversion
- (8): Jumps by a capped player shows a good suit, but not forcing

1!c (P) 1!d (Overcall at any level)
- Treat opponent's overcall as an opening bid and apply our defense accordingly (no HCP borrowing). The following are used to distinguish weak and strong responders.

| Opener's action | Weak responder's action | Strong responder's action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pass | Suit bids / Dbl (must pass next NF bid) | Dbl, then force if below game |
| Dbl | 1N (6-8) / suit / jump in suit / 2!n as Lebensohl | Cue / Jump to game |
| Bid a suit | Pass, or thru 2!n: compete or invite / Dbl for T/O (must pass next NF bid) | Bid a game / keep forcing until above 2!n |
</BiddingTree>

<Aside type="note">
When vulerable, 1!c (P) 1!d (1M); 1!n shows minors (5+4+).
</Aside>
