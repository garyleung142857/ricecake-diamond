## Interference

<BiddingTree>
1!d (Dbl or Bid)
- P: NF. 0-5(7), or 6+HCP with opponent's shown suit
- Dbl: 6+HCP. "Our board". No biddable 5-card suit or 8+ bal
- Rdbl:	8+HCP. "We have game value". Focus on penalties. Probably with a balanced hand.
- NS: 6+HCP. 5+card suit. F1
- JS: Competitive. NF
- Lowest NT: GF. Balanced hand. Good stopper in any shown suit
- 2-level Cue: GF. Ask stopper if opp shown one suit; shows stopper if shown multiple suits
- 3+level Cue: GF. Three suiter and short in the shown suit.
</BiddingTree>

### Continuation after 1!d (Dbl or Bid) Action
- NS: Forcing if below game.
- JS: Good suit and forcing if below game
- Raises
    - (by Opener) GF. Jump in opp's suit / 4-level shows shortness. 
    - (by Responder) simple raise is NF (if not already GF).
- Cue
    - (by Opener) GF. Asks stopper.
    - (by Responder) F1. Catchall
- Simple NT: Nat. NF. System on
- Jump NT: GF. System on

### Fourth Hand Bids after we confirm this is our board
- (After they raised)
    - P: Tends to be bal. Forcing
    - Dbl: T/O. Neutral if balancing position
    - Suit: Shapeful GF; 4+ cards in balancing position
    - NT: Good stop. NF
- (After they bid a new suit)
    - P: Forcing. Could be short
    - Dbl: Penalty. Neutral if balancing position
    - Suit: Shapeful GF. 4+ cards in balancing position
    - NT: Good stop. NF

### Continuation after Responder Denied Strength
- Applies in the following sequences
    - 1!d (Dbl/Bid) P (Bid/Pass)
    - 1!d (P) 1!h (Dbl/Bid)
- Follow above methods with additional below:
    - 1!d (P) 1!h (Dbl), opener's Rdbl has "opposite meaning" as opp's Dbl.
    - 1!d (Dbl) P (P). Rdbl is takeout in !d, or very strong
    - Opener's jump to 2!n in the balancing position shows a strong 2-suiter

## Opening Opposite Passed Hand

Opener shows 20+. Responder is limited to 0-7 unbal or 0-10 Bal.
Responder borrows 3 points from 1!d opener and continues as if direct opening.
