Spiral raises module is used when there is a major fit at (or a step below) 2M, and an 8-card fit is not certain.
Spiral raises are applied in the following sequences:
- 1M - 2M (Simple raises)
- 1!h - 2!d / 1!s - 2!h (Transfer raises)
- 1!h - 1!s; 2!s (Treated as simple raise)
- In competition where only 4-3 fit is established
- Any modes of the above sequence

Since an 8-card fit is not established, we have the following continuations
<BiddingTree>
... 2M (3+ card simple raise, strength is denied, i.e. Mode 0 / 3 1M - 2M)
P: No Extra shape
- 2!n: 6+M. Max
- 3m: 4=M 6+m (canape)
- 3M: (5)6+M. Blocking
</BiddingTree>

<BiddingTree>
... 2M (3+ card simple raise, strength is possible)
- P: Less than inv. Others promise inv+ values
- 2!s: 4+!s. May be 4!s4!h(41)
- 2!n: 4441 short oM
- 3m: 4=M 5+m (canape). NF
- 3!h: (After 3!s) 5+!s and !h value
- 3M: (5)6+M. Blocking
- 3!n: 4=M COG
- 4m: 4=M (6)7+m. Too great for 3m
</BiddingTree>

<BiddingTree>
... 2M-1 (3+ card transfer raise)
- 2M: Min NF. Very min if 5-cards
    - P: To play
    - 2!s: 4=!s 3=!h Inv
    - 2!n: Bal inv. 3=M
    - 3m: 5+m. NF
    - 3M: 4-5=M inv
    - 3oM: 4=oM 3=M COG
    - 3!n: 3=M COG
- Higher: Same as simple raises. Inv sequences are still inv
