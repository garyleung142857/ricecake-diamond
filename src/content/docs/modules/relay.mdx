</Aside>

## Control Ask and Sign-off Signal

If the shape relay ends at 3!s or 3!n, then
- 4!c is the control ask
- 4!d is the sign-off signal, puppet to 4!h for an signoff
- 4!h+ are natural slam tries

If the shape relay ends at or above 4!c, then the relay step is a control-ask, other bids are sign-off.

Number of controls corresponding to the first step answer
- 5+ HCP: 0 or 1
- 8+ HCP: 1 or 2
- 12+ HCP: 2 or 3
- 15+ HCP: 4

After the **first step** response (not 15+) to control ask, relay to ask the actual number. First step shows minimum, higher to show non-min and zoom to spiral scan.

<Aside type="note">
Do not count singleton King as control. Singleton Ace is counted as 2 controls.
</Aside>

## Spiral Scan

After the control-ask is spiral scanning. Honors are shown in the following priority:
- Ace / King of the first 3 suits (if bal / 5332) or the first 2 suits (if unbal)
    - Answer "No" if holding both Ace and King
    - Skip to Queens when you have shown all controls
- Queens of all suits with 3+ cards
- Jacks of all suits with 3+ cards

<Aside type="note">
- Longest suit first. Scan higher ranking suits of the same lengths first.
- Answer "Yes" by zooming to the next item; answer "no" by stopping.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
- If the relay answerer has shown a 6+ suit, the asker bidding that suit at any level is to play. The next step will be the relay step.
- 6!n+ is never an ask
- Do not zoom pass 7!c
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger" title="Unresolved Shapes">
- 62(32) or 7222 are treated like "6233" in single suit track
- 6(322) or 7222 are treated like "6333" in 2M intermediate opening
- 7(32)1 shapes are treated as "7331"
- Unresolved (65)11 or (65)20 are treated as "5511" or "5520"
</Aside>

## Relay Break

Before shapes are fully resolved, asker can break the relay:
- Up to 3!d are natural. Then only the cheapest NT shows misfit. Suits (either new or mentioned) are cuebid.
- 3!n / 4M / 5m are natural. To play unless the relay answer is uncapped and with 5+ HCP extra than min
- 3M or 4m are inv keycard asks in the corresponding suit:
    - 3!h: !c; 3!s: !d; 4!c: !h; 4!d: !s
    - First step is negative, then next non-signoff suit is re-ask
    - 2nd+ are responses to RKCB
- 4!n is balanced / misfit invite
